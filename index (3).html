        <h2>Galileo and Newton</h2>
        <p>Galileo Galilei made groundbreaking contributions to the understanding of gravity through his experiments with falling objects. However, it was Sir Isaac Newton who formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation in the late 17th century.</p>

        <h2>Modern Understanding</h2>
        <p>Since Newton's time, our comprehension of gravity has evolved with advancements in physics. Einstein's theory of general relativity revolutionized our understanding, explaining gravity as the curvature of spacetime.</p>
